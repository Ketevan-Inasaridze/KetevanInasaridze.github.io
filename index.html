						<h1>About Me!</h1>
						<p id="big-pic"> My name is Ketevan Inasaridze, from Georgia. Currently this is my sophomore year here at LCC International University. I was 17 when I moved here and I just turned 19 a little over a month ago. I am majoring in Contemporary Communications because that is the closest to what I want to do in the future. Although, I don't know exactly what path I am gonna choose but I want to be ivolved with social media and television. Most peope refer to me as a creative and positive person. I am passionate about painting and room decor. I also like modeling for beginners in photography. I am also very passionate about fashion and learnin about fashion industry. In my free time I mostly go to the local vintage second-hand stores and shop there. It has been my so-called hobby since I was 15.  </p>
