						<h1>About the website</h1>
						<p id="big-pic"> The purpose of my website is to help people get to know me. I have been obsessed with photography since young age but never really got a chance to experience being a photographer. Altthough, I own a tille camera that is older than me. I take my camera almost everywhere I go and capture some special moments for the future memories. I want to share some of my pictures with you! Here is the picture of my lovely camera that I decided to decorate.   </p>
